# Master-Project-Natasa-Mortvanski
Master project repository - Natasa Mortvanski (MSc Bioinformatics for Health Sciences 2021/2023) 
\
This is a repository containing the R project with the following directories: 
\
* 00_raw_files: 
\
  Contains all raw data files used for the analysis. The data from choosen studies was downloaded 
  from Qiita repository (https://qiita.ucsd.edu/). For each analysed study preparation file was 
  downloaded (metadata table) as well as  results of alpha diversity analysis in a form of tsv file.
 \
  Following studies were used as source of samples of different pathological conditions that affect 
  alpha diversity:

    1. Multi-omics of the gut microbial ecosystem in inflammatory bowel diseases -> 177 samples, [dataset link](https://qiita.ucsd.edu/study/description/11484)
    2. Metaomics Reveals Microbiome Based Proteolysis as a Driver of Ulcerative Colitis Severity -> 96 samples, [dataset link](https://qiita.ucsd.edu/study/description/11549)
    3. Guiding longitudinal sampling in inflammatory bowel diseases cohorts -> ...samples , [dataset link](https://qiita.ucsd.edu/study/description/2538#)
    4. Changes in Microbial Ecology after Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for recurrent C. difficile Infection Affected by Underlying Inflammatory Bowel Disease -> 95 samples, [dataset link](https://qiita.ucsd.edu/study/description/10057)
